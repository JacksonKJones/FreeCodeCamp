            <p>E-Waste is one of the fastest growing waste stream in the world and is nearly impossible to recycle. Mobile phones are a major contributor to it.</p>

            <h2>What we do</h2>
            <p>We released a concept for a modular phone that you can upgrade and repair. Google joined in and eventually killed it.</p>

        <h2>How does it work</h2>
        <p>Phonebloks was an idea for a new kind of phone. A phone that you donâ€™t have to throw away every few years because it is broken or getting slow. This modular phone can be upgraded, repaired and even customised to your needs. Phonebloks is a concept, a vision for a less wasteful future.</p>
        <p>The idea of Phonebloks was to share it online, get people to support it, and inspire phone companies to work on it as they could see a market for it. When it released it got worldwide support and triggered companies to work on it.</p>
        <p>Google took a serious attempt with <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Project_Ara">Project Ara</a> but killed a few years later because they wanted focus more on software projects. Nowadays the most noticeable modular phones are fairphone and shiftphone. Not as modular as Phonebloks but a step in the direction of less wasteful phone.</p>

        <h4>Companies got interested</h4>

        <h4>And Google killed it</h4>
        <p>Google spend 2 years developing Project Ara. We helped and consulted here and there. They managed to make a phone that actually works and can hot swap modules. Quite impressive. But all of a sudden they decided to kill the project and focus more on software. Boom. Project gone.</p>
